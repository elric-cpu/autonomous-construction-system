            Water is the silent destroyer of homes. By the time you see a puddle on the floor, the damage behind your walls may already be extensive. 
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            For Oregon homeowners accustomed to wet winters, identifying the <strong>signs of water damage</strong> early is critical. Hidden leaks don't just rot wood and ruin drywall—they create the perfect breeding ground for mold, which can start growing in as little as 24 to 48 hours.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            At Benson Home Solutions, we follow IICRC standards for inspection and mitigation. We know that what you see on the surface is often just the tip of the iceberg. Here are the top 10 warning signs that water is hiding in your walls or ceilings.
          </p>

          <div className="bg-cream border-l-4 border-maroon p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-12 mb-6">1. Discoloration or Staining</h2>
          <div className="mb-6">
            <img className="w-full h-64 object-cover rounded-lg mb-4" alt="Water stain on ceiling showing signs of hidden water damage" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1659446680489-6bb20f0c0b28" />
          </div>
          <p className="mb-4">
            One of the most obvious signs is discoloration. Look for yellow, brown, or copper-colored spots on your ceilings or walls. These "rings" often indicate where water has pooled and evaporated repeatedly. Even small, faint stains can signal a significant leak in the plumbing or roof above.
          </p>

          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-12 mb-6">2. Soft or Spongy Drywall</h2>
          <div className="mb-6">
            <img className="w-full h-64 object-cover rounded-lg mb-4" alt="Soft drywall texture indicating moisture saturation" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1655313206821-2f4550a50893" />
          </div>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Drywall acts like a sponge. When it absorbs water, it loses structural integrity. If you press on a section of your wall and it feels soft, mushy, or indented, the drywall is saturated. This is a severe sign that requires immediate removal of the affected material to prevent collapse and mold spread.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-12 mb-6">3. Peeling Paint or Wallpaper</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            When moisture builds up behind a wall, it pushes outward. This pressure breaks the bond between the wall surface and your paint or wallpaper. If you see bubbling paint, peeling edges, or wallpaper that is separating from the wall without an obvious cause, hidden moisture is the likely culprit.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-12 mb-6">4. Musty Odors</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Trust your nose. A persistent, earthy, or musty smell is a hallmark of hidden mold growth. Even if you can't see the water, the smell indicates that moisture is trapped somewhere—under floors, inside walls, or in the attic. This is particularly common in basements and bathrooms.

          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-12 mb-6">5. Visible Mold or Mildew</h2>
          <div className="mb-6">
            <img className="w-full h-64 object-cover rounded-lg mb-4" alt="Mold growth on wall from hidden water damage" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1702092488232-77271dabe623" />
          </div>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If you see small black, green, or white specks on your baseboards, ceiling corners, or walls, you likely have a larger problem behind the surface. Surface mold is often the "bloom" of a root system established deep in the damp drywall or insulation.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-12 mb-6">6. Warped or Buckled Walls</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Sheetrock and wood framing swell when wet. This can cause your walls to bow, warp, or buckle. If a wall that was previously straight now looks wavy or curved, it is absorbing moisture. This indicates long-term exposure and potential structural compromise.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-12 mb-6">7. Sagging Ceilings</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            A sagging ceiling is an emergency. It indicates that water is pooling on top of the drywall or plaster, creating immense weight. This is a major safety hazard, as the ceiling could collapse. If you notice a "bubble" or sag in your ceiling, move valuables out of the area and call for emergency help immediately.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-12 mb-6">8. Increased Humidity or Condensation</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Does your home feel sticky or clammy? Do windows fog up excessively, even when you aren't cooking or showering? Excess indoor humidity often comes from a hidden water source constantly evaporating into your home's air.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-12 mb-6">9. Pest Activity</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Insects like silverfish, ants, and termites love damp environments. Rodents are also attracted to soft, water-damaged wood. A sudden infestation can sometimes be traced back to a hidden leak providing the pests with the moisture they need to thrive.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-12 mb-6">10. Rising Water Stains</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Unlike ceiling stains that come from above, marks that start at the floor and creep up the wall indicate "wicking." This usually stems from a slab leak, foundation issue, or flooding that wasn't properly dried. This water is often absorbed directly into the framing of your home.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Check under sinks and behind toilets regularly.</li>

          </ul>

          <p className="mb-4">Water damage moves fast. Within minutes, it spreads to other areas of your home. Within hours, it begins to warp wood and degrade drywall. Within 48 hours, mold growth can begin. Acting quickly is essential to saving your home and minimizing repair costs.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-8 mb-4">1. Ensure Safety First</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Before doing anything, ensure it is safe to enter the area. If standing water has reached electrical outlets or if the ceiling is sagging, do not enter. Turn off the electricity to the affected area from the breaker box if it is safe to do so.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-8 mb-4">2. Stop the Water Source</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">If the water is coming from a burst pipe or appliance, shut off the main water valve immediately. This is usually located in the basement, crawlspace, or near the street. If the flooding is from a natural disaster, focus on safety and evacuation.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-8 mb-4">3. Call a Professional Mitigation Company</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Call Benson Home Solutions immediately at (541) 321-5115. We offer 24/7 emergency service. The sooner we arrive with professional extraction and drying equipment, the better chance you have of saving flooring and drywall.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-8 mb-4">4. Document the Damage</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">While waiting for help, take photos and videos of all damaged areas and items for insurance purposes. Do not throw away damaged items until your adjuster has seen them.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-8 mb-4">5. Begin Water Removal (If Safe)</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">If safe, you can start mopping up standing water or using a wet/dry vac. Move valuables, electronics, and furniture to a dry area. Place aluminum foil under furniture legs to prevent staining on wet carpets.</p>

          <p className="mb-4">Finding fungal growth in your home is alarming, but knowing the difference between mold and mildew can help you determine the severity of the problem and the right course of action.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-8 mb-4">What is Mildew?</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Mildew is a surface fungi that is typically gray or white and powdery. It often appears on moist surfaces like shower grout, windowsills, or damp fabric. Because it grows on the surface, it can often be cleaned with standard household cleaners and a scrub brush.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-8 mb-4">What is Mold?</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Mold is often darker (green, black, red, or blue) and can look fuzzy or slimy. Crucially, mold roots into porous materials like drywall, wood, and insulation. You cannot simply wipe it away because the "roots" remain deep inside the material.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-8 mb-4">When to Call a Professional</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">If you are dealing with surface mildew on tile, you can likely handle it yourself. However, you should call Benson Home Solutions if:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>The affected area is larger than 10 square feet.</li>
            <li>The mold is on porous material (drywall, wood, carpet).</li>
            <li>There is a strong musty odor.</li>
            <li>You have had recent water damage.</li>
            <li>Family members are experiencing respiratory issues.</li>

          <p className="mb-4">Planning a bathroom remodel in Oregon? Understanding where your budget goes is the first step to a successful project. While every project is unique, several key factors drive the final cost.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-8 mb-4">1. Scope of Work</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">A "pull-and-replace" remodel (new fixtures in the same location) is significantly cheaper than a layout change. Moving plumbing lines (to move a toilet or shower) requires opening walls and floors, increasing labor and material costs.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-8 mb-4">2. Materials and Finishes</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">This is the biggest variable. A standard fiberglass tub/shower unit costs much less than a custom tiled walk-in shower. Similarly, stock vanities are more affordable than custom cabinetry. Tile costs vary from $2/sq ft to over $50/sq ft.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-8 mb-4">3. Labor and Trades</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">A bathroom remodel involves multiple specialized trades: demolition, carpentry, plumbing, electrical, drywall, tiling, and painting. Skilled labor is an investment in longevity—poorly installed waterproofing can lead to thousands in rot repair later.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-contractor-black mt-8 mb-4">4. Hidden Issues</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Especially in older Oregon homes, we often find water damage or outdated plumbing/electrical once walls are opened. We recommend setting aside a 10-15% contingency fund for these unforeseen repairs.</p>
